A user has requested assignment to a role that needs approval from an admin 
for the jurisdiction <%= @role_request.jurisdiction.name %>

User <%= @role_request.requester.name %> (<%= @role_request.requester.email %>)  is requesting 
the role <%= @role_request.role.name %>.  You may approve or deny this request at the following link:

<%= role_request_url(@role_request) %>

Please be sure to verify the user's credentials for the role he or she is requesting.  If in doubt,
it is better to delay or deny the request until you can verify the user.
