Feature: Sending alerts form

  In order to ensure only accessible information is displayed on the form
  As an admin
  Users should not be able to see certain information on the form
  
  Scenario: Sending alerts form should not contain system roles
    Given there is an system only Admin role
    And the following users exist:
      | John Smith      | john.smith@example.com   | Public | Dallas County |
    And I am logged in as "john.smith@example.com"
    When I go to the alerts page
    And I follow "New Alert"
    Then I should not see "Admin" in the "Roles" dropdown
